# FreeArticles
Free articles and things for everyone to view.

This is not an archive for every article in existence, merely the ones I want to share.

To read free articles yourself, please use [this extension](https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome), or https://12ft.io

If you like, feel free to contribute your own articles, but the name format must be:\
`<site>`/`<year>`/`<3-char month>`/`<day>`/`<arbitrary string>.md` according to the publication/edited time.\
For example: `Bloomberg`/`2023`/`mar`/`22`/`iqjWHBFdfxIU.md` for [this article][1]

If possible, the arbitrary string should be the article ID. This bloomberg example had the ID in the URL
of the pictures. If not, don't worry, it just shouldn't match any other article.

If possible, please link to other free articles in this repo. If not, don't worry. It's just an archive.
