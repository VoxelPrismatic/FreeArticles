For weeks, the same awkward scene played out again and again in \
sexually transmitted infection clinics across the United States. \
Half-naked gay men stood with their pants around their ankles \
while clinicians crouched between their legs, swabs at the ready. \
The clinicians were covered head-to-toe in hazmat chic: gowns, \
gloves, face shields and N95 respirators. The men were covered in \
something much worse: painful lesions, on their genitals, their \
anuses and sometimes even their faces and limbs.

It was July of 2022, just last summer, and an outbreak of mpox — \
formerly known as monkeypox — was in full swing. From a \
handful of cases in a few cities in early May, the outbreak surged to \
more than 16,000 cases in 75 countries and territories just two \
months later. It was terrifying.

The sudden appearance of so many mpox cases everywhere and all at \
once was shocking. Aside from an occasional case among \
travelers from countries in West or Central Africa, where the virus \
is endemic, mpox was extremely rare in Europe or North America. \
The United States had seen only one outbreak, back in 2003, \
among Midwesterners with pet prairie dogs that had been housed \
with infected African rodents. There were [47 cases][1] then and no \
documented cases of human-to-human transmission.

This time was different. In early May of 2022, mpox found its way \
to gay raves in Spain and Belgium, huge annual parties that draw \
men from all over the world. Clothing was scant, grinding was \
plentiful and when the parties were over everyone flew home. \
Within weeks, mpox cases — resulting from human-to-human \
transmission — began cropping up in cities worldwide.

While the outbreak caught the public unaware, public health \
officials had been warned. Five years earlier, [Dr. Dimie Ogoina][2] had \
observed unusual cases in Nigeria, first in an 11-year-old boy and \
then among young men who'd reported multiple sex partners or \
encounters with sex workers. He soon realized that this was not \
"the regular monkeypox we know" and tried to [alert the scientific \
community][3] about the possibility of sexual transmission.

And just as we were grappling with proof that Dr. Ogoina was right \
about everything — right that something had changed, right that \
mpox was transmitted sexually and right to raise the alarm — \
testing revealed that the mpox virus could survive on linens or \
clothing for [more than two weeks][4]. While we were both primarily \
concerned for those already suffering from mpox and those at \
highest risk of contracting the virus, we feared what might happen \
if mpox made its way into [hotel rooms][5] and onto [cruise ships][6] and \
[college campuses][7]. (Think of all those frat house couches that are \
rarely cleaned.) This outbreak could become an epidemic, perhaps \
even a pandemic.

Luckily, we were wrong.

While mpox could live on surfaces, it turned out [it didn't spread \
that way][8]. The virus required close, sustained contact to spread, \
which is why it was fanning out overwhelmingly through sex. So \
this outbreak that started in gay and bisexual communities mostly \
stayed in those communities, but not for long. On Jan. 31, 2023, the \
federal government declared an end to the [mpox emergency][9], as \
average case counts fell from a peak of over 450 per day in early \
August to less than five during the last week of January. While the \
outbreak in the United States lasted just under nine months, it \
caused plenty of damage, resulting in more than [30,000 cases and \
42 deaths][10].

While the outbreak ended faster than many believed it would, it \
was far worse than it needed to be, representing both a public \
health triumph and a public health failure. Both health officials and \
the media failed to expediently warn and engage the gay \
community in the outbreak's crucial first weeks.

When the first cases were reported among gay and bi men in the \
West, health authorities and the media couldn't bring themselves \
to say the word "gay." To avoid stigmatizing gay and bi men, early \
reports [buried the lead][11]. The Associated Press didn't mention that \
this outbreak was being seen almost exclusively in gay men until \
15 paragraphs into one report; other [reports][12] didn't mention gay \
and bi men at all. A gay man scanning headlines in May of last year \
might have learned of an outbreak — but unless he had traveled to \
West Africa recently, or had contact with infected rodents or \
primates, he could have easily concluded that he wasn't at risk.

While this desire to avoid stigmatizing gay and bisexual men was \
understandable, it wasn't helpful. We know gay sex has been \
unfairly blamed for everything from natural disasters to the fall of \
Rome. But in their efforts to avoid stigmatizing the community, \
health authorities and the media failed to effectively warn gay and \
bi men. Ignorant of the threat as the virus spread, gay and bi men \
couldn't take steps to protect themselves and their partners.

Unfortunately, stigma and discrimination found the community \
anyway. Gay men with mpox were [turned away][13] from urgent care \
clinics and emergency rooms. Phlebotomists [refused to draw their \
blood][14]. Like its predecessors Covid-19 and H.I.V./AIDS, mpox had \
all the makings of a public health disaster. It took nearly two \
months into the outbreak for [testing to become widely available][15]. A \
dearth of vaccines created "[Hunger Games][16]"-like scenarios in cities \
throughout the country, with vaccine clinics opening and then \
[shutting their doors][17] for lack of supply. Cases began to appear in a \
small handful of transgender people and cisgender women and \
children, raising alarm about wider spread.

Even after it was evident that this painful, potentially disfiguring \
or even fatal infection was spreading through gay men's sexual \
networks, public health officials and the media were [hesitant to \
give][18] the same advice they had given freely at the beginning of the \
Covid pandemic: Limit your number of sex partners and express \
your sexuality in socially distanced ways.

But while health officials and journalists hesitated, gay and bi men \
sprang into action. Young men with lesions covering their faces \
took to social and mainstream media, telling the public that they \
were dealing with "the [worst pain I've experienced in my life][19]" and, \
perhaps the most telling, "[I'd rather have Covid][20]." [Benjamin Ryan][21], a \
gay journalist, and [Carlton Thomas][22], a gay doctor, risked \
cancellation — e.g., being yelled at on Twitter — to dish out what \
Dr. Thomas referred to as "tough love" advice for their community: \
Slam the brakes on sex outside of committed relationships; seek \
immediate medical care for symptoms; and get vaccinated as soon \
as possible.

And the gay community listened.

Gay party promoters canceled long-planned events and individual \
gay men temporarily deleted hookup apps from their phones and \
reduced their sexual contacts. The Centers for Disease Control and \
Prevention verified these shifts in behavior, [reporting that][23] half of \
gay men surveyed reduced their number of sex partners, one-time \
sexual encounters and use of dating apps during the outbreak. And \
gay and bi men got vaccinated in droves; two-thirds of those \
surveyed by the Pew Research Center in September 2022 reported \
that they had already received an mpox vaccine or were planning \
to do so. Gay and bi men endured frustrating attempts to secure \
appointments for the crucial first dose of the two-dose series and \
hourslong waits at pop-up vaccination sites. Of the over one million \
doses of the Jynneos vaccine (protective against smallpox and \
mpox) administered in the United States since June 2022, more \
[than 90 percent were given to men][24] (presumably gay and bisexual \
men).

Communications teams at the C.D.C. made great strides during this \
time. They acknowledged the realities of gay sexuality and its \
breadth of expression, using the actual language gay men use \
when discussing sex with each other. The words "[fetish gear][25]" \
appeared on a C.D.C. website for the first time; the clinical term \
"anus" became the more user-friendly "[butthole][25]," and instead \
of "public sex environments," the C.D.C. spoke frankly about "back \
rooms" and "sex parties" and the risk of contracting mpox in those \
spaces.

While those warning gay men to cut back on sex until they were \
vaccinated against mpox experienced accusations of fomenting \
stigma — echoing pushback experienced by gay men who urged \
others to avoid bathhouses and start using condoms at the start of \
the AIDS crisis in the early 1980s — efforts to shoot the messenger \
were less aggressive than in years past. One key difference \
between H.I.V./AIDS and mpox: Many of the messengers were gay \
and bisexual men themselves, including gay journalists, doctors \
and average citizens with access to social media, plus a generation \
of gay men who had been inspired to pursue public health careers \
in the wake of AIDS.

The C.D.C.'s chosen spokesman to lead national conversations on \
mpox and gay men's sexual health wasn't a straight doctor in a lab \
coat who squirmed at the mention of gay sex. Instead, it was Dr. \
Demetre Daskalakis, an out gay man who not only attends raves \
but posts shirtless selfies on social media to prove it. This was a \
messenger the community would listen to.

Gay and bi men had already written the playbook on activism and \
advocacy throughout the H.I.V./AIDS epidemic, resulting in more \
than [$7 billion in federal funding][26] for H.I.V. research, prevention, \
treatment and social services. Furious over the federal \
government's initial response to mpox, they mobilized and \
organized, protesting at local Department of Health and Human \
Services offices and [filing a complaint][27] with the Massachusetts \
state attorney general over denial of mpox testing and treatment.

So while an early and frankly honest public health response could \
have blunted the outbreak, resulting in far fewer cases and far less \
suffering, the swift collective action of gay and bi men prevented \
catastrophe. If the broader American public had responded to the \
threat of Covid-19 the way gay and bi men responded to the threat \
of mpox, we might have seen fewer cases (there have been 100 \
million to date) and a lower death toll (1.1 million and counting). \
When the next infectious outbreak strikes (and surely it will), the \
public would be wise to channel gay and bi men: communicate \
openly without stigmatization, organize and insist on access to \
effective prevention, diagnosis and treatment.

There's another important lesson about the gay community that \
health officials and journalists need to remember going forward: \
When it comes to emerging health threats — even ones that can \
spread sexually — gay men can handle the truth. You can give it to \
them straight.
